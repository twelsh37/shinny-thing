          3 people who wanted to cut a different path to their experiences in
          previous agency lives. No presenteeism, no constant late nights to
          &lsquo;prove our worth&rsquo;, no aim of becoming 100 strong, no
          global offices, and certainly no bean bags. Just good people with
          great ideas.

          From our humble beginnings in a temporary tree house in Hoxton to our
          current home in the old school original creative epicentre of London,
          Soho, our approach to studio life hasn&apos;t changed; be proud, be
          passionate and, most importantly, be yourself.
